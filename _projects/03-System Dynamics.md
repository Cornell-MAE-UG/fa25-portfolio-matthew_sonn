[REPORT LINKED HERE]({{ "assets/MAE 3260 Final Group Work.pdf" | relative_url }})

My final project for MAE 3260: System Dynamics was to work in a team of four students to choose a dynamical system to dissect, and then design a method of controlling this system. My group chose a multi-story building subject to external forcing like an earthquake or wind, and we designed an active control system that acts to mitigate the forces felt by the building, and thus reduce displacements and accelerations in upper floors. As a part of this project, we implemented MATLAB simulations to confirm the validity of our dynamical model and the effectiveness of our control system. All of our research culminated in a 10 page final report which derives the governing equations of motion and describes how an active, feed-forward control system was implemented into our model.
