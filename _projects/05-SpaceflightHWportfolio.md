[Orbital Mechanics/Maneuvers]({{ "assets/MAE 4060 HW Portfolio-1-20.pdf" | relative_url }}).

[Attitude Representations/Maneuvers]({{ "assets/MAE 4060 HW Portfolio-21-49_compressed.pdf" | relative_url }}).

For MAE 4060: Spaceflight Mechanics, we were required to complete all of our homeworks and submit as one PDF at the end of the semester. In these homeworks, I demonstrate knowledge and proficiency with the following skills:

- MATLAB
- Simulink
- Orbital elements and pertubations
- Orbital maneuvers (delta-V calculations, Hohmann Transfers)
- Propellant mass requirements
- Interplanetary trajectories, flyby maneuvers, spheres of influence
- The transport equation
- Direction Cosine Matricies
- Quaternions
- Nutation frequency
- Euler's Equations
- Spin stability using CMGs and RWAs
