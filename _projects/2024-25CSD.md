As a member of Cornell Seismic Design, I was heavily involved in the design, construction, testing, and analysis of a cable dampening system for the 5-ft tall balsa wood structure. In order to reduce the amplitude and velocity of our building's oscillations, we implemented cross-body cables that on each face of the building that went into tension, pulling the building back to its equilibrium position when the building was shaken under a simulated earthquake. 

Besides the springs and the cables, all of the damper's parts were designed and manufactured using Autodesk Fusion 360. These models were then 3D printed and implemented into the building. I conducted all of the Fusion modeling, and reders of the design can be found in the attached damper proposal. The design, testing, and analysis process was documented in a damper proposal sent to the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI) for review and approval in our competition, and it is attached [here]({{ "assets/CornellUniversityDamperProposal2025 (1).pdf" | relative_url }}).

In addition to the damper, I was also involved in the structural design process. Every year, the EERI provides a the architectural plans of the building that is to be built that contains "no-build" zones, which creates a unique design challenge for the compeition every year. Last year, there was a hole that was a few stories tall, and ran through a diagonal in the building. This introduced torsional concerns, as the building was not symmetrical about the shaking axes. Our approach to our structural design took that into consideration, and more specifics can be found in our competition proposal here.

I was inspired by this old radio when I made this rendering:
