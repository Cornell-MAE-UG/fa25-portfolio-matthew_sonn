My final project for MAE 3270: Mechanics of Engineering Materials was to design a torque wrench's dimensions and choose a material such that it meets the following requirements:

- Attain at least 1.0 mV/V output at the rated torque of 600 in-lbf
- Safety factor of X=4 for yield or brittle failure
- Safety factor of X=2 for crack growth from an assumed crack of depth 0.04 inches (1 mm)
- Fatigue stress safety factor of X = 1.5
- Material must bee a steel, aluminum, or titanium alloy
