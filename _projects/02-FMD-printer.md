My final project for MAE 3230: Fluid Mechanics was to perform a fluid mechanical dissection on a machine. My group was assigned an inkjet printer. We worked to take apart the printer, learned how the ink cartridges work to dispense ink in a precise manner, then made a 5 minute video outlining how an inkjet printer works with relevant equations and fluid mechanical concepts. This project was conducted with a group of 4 other students. I contributed in the dissection, the fluid mechanical analysis of the system, helping to define the relevant concepts and equations, and participating in the creation of the video. The video is linked below.
