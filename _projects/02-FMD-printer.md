My final project for MAE 3230: Fluid Mechanics was to perform a fluid mechanical dissection on a machine. My group was assigned an inkjet printer. We worked to take apart the printer, learned how the ink cartridges work to dispense ink in a precise manner, then made a 5 minute video outlining how an inkjet printer works with relevant equations and fluid mechanical concepts. This project was conducted in a group of 4 other students.
