#### Work Experience
- **Jane Street Capital - Incoming Mechanical Engineering Intern**  
  May, 2026 - August, 2026
  
- **Wick Fisher White - Mechanical HVAC Engineering Intern**  
  May, 2025 - August, 2025  
  - Performed detailed building load calculations using TRACE 3D to determine airflow, ventilation, and equipment sizing for large
scale commercial and mission-critical facilities. Used load calculations to make cost-conscious HVAC system design decisions
  - Produced CAD and Revit models of HVAC systems while ensuring adherence to industry and firm-specific drafting standards
  - Conducted site visits to evaluate construction and demolition progress, survey existing building systems, and identify 
opportunities for reuse in new design goals. Documented survey results in site visit reports and CAD documents.

- **Cornell University Physics Department**  
  August, 2025 - December, 2025  
  - Co-lead weekly discussion sections for physics and engineering majors, guiding problem-solving in Cornell’s Physics II: 
Electromagnetism class and helping students strengthen their conceptual understanding of the course content 
  - Completed Phys 4484: Teaching and Learning Physics, a pedagogy course emphasizing active learning, leadership in small
group settings, and effective scientific communication. Directly applied these skills while co-leading physics discussion sections 
  - Collaborate with faculty and graduate instructors to align discussion materials with lecture content and course objectives
